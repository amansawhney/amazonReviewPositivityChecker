["This works wonders for itchy scalps. You will instantly feel the results. However, there is a price to pay; it significantly dries out your hair. If your hair isn't short try to keep this shampoo as close to your scalp and roots as possible. Don't lather up all your hair to the ends. After shampooing treat your lovely locks with a deep conditioner. This is a huge bottle and will last for a long time. Fortunately, it has a two year shelf life. Additionally, this stuff smells pretty awful, but that's only because it's medicated. It's a step up from Head and Shoulders. It's harsh on your hair and it stinks, but that's nothing compared to scratching your head all day; that can be miserable.", "I have used this shampoo twice....every other day using a non-therapeutic shampoo in between.  I'm already seeing improvement with less itch and healing scalp.  Can't say I love the smell....but if it works, I will happily deal with that minor issue.", "Tried countless numbers of anti-dandruff shampoos and non of them worked. My head was always itchy and the dandruff had spread to my hairline so you can imagine how bad it looked.I read online that you can see changes within days of using it, but that wasn't the case for me.I started using T/Gel on March. For the first week or two, it didn't seem like the shampoo was helping. In fact, my dandruff got worse. It got itchier than before. However, I was desperate to get rid of my dandruff and nothing else worked so I kept using it.Around the fourth or fifth week there were no flakes visible on my hair and it rarely got itchy.After 2-3 months, it was completely gone.3 months of use and I've used up less than half of the bottle.Remember to follow the instructions; leave it on for 5 minutes. First few days I used it like any ordinary shampoo which might be why I didn't see any change.I use T/Gel 2 times a week with a random cheap scalp brush I bought from Amazon. When I first started I used it 4 times a week because my dandruff was just unbearable.I was worried about the smell after reading some of the reviews but I personally love it!", "I was sensitive to the gel used in an EEG exam and came down with a truly spectacular case of dandruff. After a month of torment an MD friend suggested T/Gel. Believe it or not, one treatment is all it took. A month later, with T/Gel two or three times a week, my scalp is better than it's been for the past 50 years. As far as I'm concerned this is a genuine miracle cure.As a bonus, my cat is fascinated by the smell of it and pushes his face into the palms of my hands, purring like mad. I'm going to try a drop or two on one of his toys. He doesn't lick it, so I'm not worried about the chemistry.", "I had horrible, horrible, terrible post partum dandruff and Head and Shoulders was useless. I couldn't stand smelling like tee tree oil or cider vinegar so I ordered this and had relief from the itch after the first use. After about two weeks, the dandruff was pretty much gone. Now, a few months later, I'm still using it but it seems to has lost some of it's efficacy and as some flaking and itching is returning. Still better than it was, though, so overall a positive experience.", "First month of use gave me a pleasant surprise as to how good this product is. It really worked on my itchy skull. But I am writing this after more than 2 months of use, and now I feel like my skull is again started itching. Somehow I feel like the effect started to fade away slowly or my skull got used to this oil. So, yes, it is not working for me the way it worked in 1st month of use.I use this alternate days. Now I have decided to use it daily, just to see if it works for me again.", "I cannot get over the horrible smell. It lingers for about two days. Used it three times and it didn't do anything for my scalp. I have psoriasis on my scalp and the only things that helps was the nioxin shampoo and conditioner. Buy that one instead.", "After years of outrageously expensive prescription shampoos and lotions that did not work, coal tar shampoo is the only product that works for my scalp psoriasis. If this is the first time you are using it, be prepared. The smell is awful and overpowering. But over the years I have gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me at all anymore."]
