Makes me wary since that kind of literature is generally frowned upon by homeland security!  lol", 0.3542, "Great product", 0.375, "It was for my husband and he loved it.", 4.1686, "I saw this book at half price books a long time ago, but always wanted to buy it, so I ordered it here. Love it! It's really cool to see the perspective of the writer, and different cool interesting techniques and ideas. I like Abbie because he fought for something good he believed in.", 1.0625, "A classic! This is a MUST BUY for any budding young activist! I got copies of this for my niece and nephew - a rite of passage of sorts!", 0.375, "Interesting read.", -1.0, "Outdated in many respects but interesting nonetheless.", 1.3062000000000002, "Steal This Book is a nice, interesting book to read. There are some interesting items in the book that if followed today, would easily land you in jail. Whether or not the author got away with the majority of these items to steal is questionable. The book was written decades ago and some of the items mentioned will not mean anything to todays generations. But for those of us who came of age in the 1960's, it will bring a laugh or two and good memories. I would not spend the money on a new or a hard copy, but if you come across it in paperback and used, go for it."]
